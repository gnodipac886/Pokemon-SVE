# Pokemon-SVE
System Verilog Pokemon for ECE 385 Final Project

## Introduction 
In this project, we implement a USB and VGA system that is able to control the movement of our character on a screen with USB keyboard inputs. Depending on which one of WASD key we input, the character will “go” into the corresponding direction. 

The goal of the project is to recreate the Psychic gym of the classic Pokemon Fire Red game. The gym consists of 9 rooms, and several more teleportation pads that allows the player to explore the other rooms. In the game the player is supposed to try to get to the center room, room 5, in order to fight the gym leader and get the badge. Due to time limitations, we have only been able to implement the teleportation logic in SystemVerilog.
